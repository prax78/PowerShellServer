# PowerShell Server
** PowerShell Server 0.01
    You can run your favorite powershell commands through a browser :).
    I am using the Balzor Server App that basically calls Powershell.exe on a system where it is hosted and executes user
    Powershell commands and disaplays it on a browser page.
    
    Also added option to Kill Powershell processes [This will help you to kill your long running scrtips] running on the servers where this app will be hosted.
     
       
           
           ** How to run it!!
           ** Please download ASP.NET runtime first https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-6.0.7-windows-x86-installer [Reboot not required]
           1 Download PowerShellServer.zip from the Download.
           2 Extract contents of the ZIP.
           3 Simply run ps1.exe , this will open connections using your server ip, for example if it is 10.10.10.10, then it will open 
             connection like http://10.10.10.10:5005 [If you want to change, clone the repository and edit as per your needs :) ].
