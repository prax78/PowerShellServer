# PowerShell Server
** PowerShell Server 0.01
    You can run your favorite powershell commands through a browser :).
    I am using the Balzor Server App that basically calls Powershell.exe on a system where it is hosted and executes user
    Powershell commands and disaplays it on a browser page.
    
    Also added option to Kill Powershell processes [This will help you to kill your long running scrtips] running on the servers where this app will be hosted.
     
       
           
           ** How to run it!!
